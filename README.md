# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction

This individual project was developed as part of a Machine Learning course assignment to predict whether a bank customer will churn or not using a dataset from Kaggle. The workflow included exploratory data analysis, feature preprocessing, feature encoding, train-test splitting, and scaling numerical variables.  
A few models were tested, and Random Forest was the best, therefore it was selected for its better performance compared to the others. The model achieved around 83% accuracy, and then improved to 86% after hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV. Meanwhile, the evaluation process was done by using confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC curves.  
This project demonstrates a structured end-to-end machine learning process, from exploratory data and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and optimization.
